This is termed Visual Interactive Simulation (VIS) and can help users understand where process problems and delays occur in a patient pathway; albeit with the caveat that single replications can be outliers. A potential FOSS solution compatible with a browser-based app could use a Python package that can represent a queuing network, such as NetworkX, and displaying results via matplotlib. If sophisticated VIS is essential for a FOSS model then researchers may need to look outside of web apps; for example, salabim provides a powerful FOSS solution for custom animation of DES models.\n> -  Monks T and Harper A. Improving the usability of open health service delivery simulation models using Python and web apps [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]. NIHR Open Res 2023, 3:48 (https://doi.org/10.3310/nihropenres.13467.2)\n\n\nThis package allows visually appealing, flexible visualisations of the movement of entities through some kind of pathway.\n\nIt is primarily tested with discrete event simulations to be created from simpy models, such as the examples below.\n\n\n\n---\n\nPlotly is leveraged to create the final animation, meaning that users can benefit from the ability to further customise or extend the plotly plot, as well as easily integrating with web frameworks such as Streamlit, Dash or Shiny for Python.\n\nThe code has been designed to be flexible and could potentially be used with alternative simulation packages such as ciw or simmer if it is possible to provide all of the required details in the logs that are output.\n\n## Examples\n\nTo develop and demonstrate the concept, it has so far been used to incorporate visualisation into several existing simpy models that were not initially designed with this sort of visualisation in mind:\n- **a minor injuries unit**, showing the utility of the model at high resolutions with branching pathways and the ability to add in a custom background to clearly demarcate process steps\n\n{{< video videos/vidigi.mp4 >}}\n\n- **an elective surgical pathway** (with a focus on cancelled theatre slots due to bed unavailability in recovery areas), with length of stay displayed as well as additional text and graphical data\n\n{{< video videos/vidigi_orthopaedic_surgery_beds.mp4 >}}\n\n- **a community mental health assessment pathway**, showing the wait to an appointment as well as highlighting 'urgent' patients with a different icon and showing the time from referral to appointment below the patient icons when they attend the appointment.\n\n{{< video videos/vidigi_community_mental_health.mp4 >}}\n\n- **a community mental health assessment pathway with pooling of clinics**, showing the 'home' clinic for clients via icon so the balance between 'home' and 'other' clients can be explored.\n\n{{< video videos/vidigi_community_mental_health_pooled.mp4 >}}\n\n- **a community mental health assessment and treatment pathway**, showing the movement of clients between a wait list, a booking list, and returning for repeat appointments over a period of time while sitting on a caseload in between.\n\n{{< video videos/vidigi_community_mental_health_complex_repeat_caseload.mp4 >}}\n\n# Usage Instructions with SimPy\n\n## Creating a visualisation from an existing model\n\nTwo key things need to happen to existing models to work with the visualisation code:\n1. All simpy resources need to be changed to simpy stores containing a custom resource with an ID attribute\n2. Logging needs to be added at key points: **arrival, (queueing, resource use start, resource use end), departure**\nwhere the steps in the middle can be repeated for as many queues and resource types as required\n\n### 1. All simpy resources need to be changed to simpy stores containing a custom resource with an ID attribute\n\nTo allow the use of resources to be visualised correctly - with entities staying with the same resource throughout the time they are using it - it is essential to be able to identify and track individual resources.\n\nBy default, this is not possible with Simpy resources. They have no ID attribute or similar.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click here for behind-the-scenes details on this</summary>\n\nThe easiest workaround which drops fairly painlessly into existing models is to use a simpy store with a custom resource class.\n\nThe custom resource is setup as follows:\n\n::: {#4691254e .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass CustomResource(simpy.Resource):\n    def __init__(self, env, capacity, id_attribute=None):\n        super().__init__(env, capacity)\n        self.id_attribute = id_attribute\n\n    def request(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Add logic to handle the ID attribute when a request is made\n        return super().request(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def release(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Add logic to handle the ID attribute when a release is made\n        return super().release(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe creation of simpy resources is then replaced with the following pattern:\n\n::: {#7e0ffabd .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbeds = simpy.Store(environment)\n\nfor i in range(number_of_beds):\n    beds.put(\n        CustomResource(\n            environment,\n            capacity=1,\n            id_attribute=i+1)\n        )\n```\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n`vidigi.resources` provides a helper function for setting up simpy resources in the required manner.\n\nFor a given resource that would have been created like this:\n\n::: {#18a7c613 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnurses = simpy.Resource(simpy_environment, capacity=number_of_nurses)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou would use\n\n::: {#35747a30 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom vidigi.resources import populate_store\nnurses = simpy.Store(simpy_environment)\n\npopulate_store(num_resources=number_of_nurses, simpy_store=nurses, sim_env=simpy_environment)\n```\n:::\n\n\nInstead of requesting a resource in the standard way, you instead use the .get() method.\n\n::: {#26235e53 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nreq = beds.get()\n```\n:::\n\n\nor\n\n::: {#9daeb5fc .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nwith beds.get() as req:\n  ...CODE HERE THAT USES THE RESOURCE...\n```\n:::\n\n\nAt the end, it is important to put the resource back into the store, even if you used the 'with' notation, so it can be made available to the next requester:\n\n::: {#7314e5c6 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbeds.put(req)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis becomes slightly more complex with conditional requesting (for example, where a resource request is made but if it cannot be fulfilled in time, the requester will renege). This is demonstrated in example 3.\n\nThe benefit of this is that when we are logging, we can use the `.id_attribute` attribute of the custom resource to record the resource that was in use.\nThis can have wider benefits for monitoring individual resource utilisation within your model as well.\n\n### 2. Logging needs to be added at key points\n\nThe animation function needs to be passed an event log with the following layout:\n\n| patient | pathway  | event_type        | event                    | time | resource_id |\n|---------|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|------|-------------|\n| 15      | Primary  | arrival_departure | arrival                  | 1.22 |             |\n| 15      | Primary  | queue             | enter_queue_for_bed      | 1.35 |             |\n| 27      | Revision | arrival_departure | arrival                  | 1.47 |             |\n| 27      | Revision | queue             | enter_queue_for_bed      | 1.58 |             |\n| 12      | Primary  | resource_use_end  | post_surgery_stay_ends   | 1.9  | 4           |\n| 15      | Revision | resource_use      | post_survery_stay_begins | 1.9  | 4           |\n\nOne easy way to achieve this is by appending dictionaries to a list at each important point in the process.\nFor example:\n\n::: {#8d4e1b8c .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nevent_log = []\n...\n...\nevent_log.append(\n      {'patient': id,\n      'pathway': 'Revision',\n      'event_type': 'resource_use',\n      'event': 'post_surgery_stay_begins',\n      'time': self.env.now,\n      'resource_id': bed.id_attribute}\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe list of dictionaries can then be converted to a pandas dataframe using\n\n::: {#3b3bf0c6 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npd.DataFrame(event_log)\n```\n:::\n\n\nand passed to the animation function where required.\n\n#### Event types\n\nFour event types are supported in the model: 'arrival_departure', 'resource_use', 'resource_use_end', and 'queue'.\n\nAs a minimum, you will require the use of 'arrival_departure' events and one of\n- 'resource_use'/'resource_use_end'\n- OR 'queue'\n\nYou can also use both 'resource_use' and 'queue' within the same model very effectively (see `ex_1_simplest_case` and `ex_2_branching_and_optional_paths`).\n\n##### arrival_departure\n\nWithin this, a minimum of two 'arrival_departure' events per entity are mandatory - `arrival` and `depart`, both with an event_type of `arrival_departure`, as shown below.\n\n::: {#5c9ba500 .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nevent_log.append(\n      {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n      'pathway': 'Revision',\n      'event_type': 'arrival_departure',\n      'event': 'arrival',\n      'time': env.now}\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#1d8cb282 .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nevent_log.append(\n      {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n      'pathway': 'Revision',\n      'event_type': 'arrival_departure',\n      'event': 'depart',\n      'time': env.now}\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThese are critical as they are used to determine when patients should first and last appear in the model.\nForgetting to include a departure step for all types of patients can lead to slow model performance as the size of the event logs for individual moments will continue to increase indefinitely.\n\n##### queue\n\nQueues are key steps in the model.\n\nIt is possible to solely use queues and never make use of a simpy resource.\n\nBy tracking each important step in the process as a 'queue' step, the movement of patients can be accurately tracked.\n\nPatients will be ordered by the point at which they are added to the queue, with the first entries appearing at the front (bottom-right) of the queue.\n\n::: {#5693b981 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nevent_log.append(\n            {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n             'pathway': 'High intensity',\n             'event_type': 'queue',\n             'event': 'appointment_booked_waiting',\n             'time': self.env.now\n             }\n        )\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhile the keys shown above are mandatory, you can add as many additional keys to a step's log as desired. This can allow you to flexibly make use of the event log for other purposes as well as the animation.\n\n##### resource_use and resource_use_end\n\nResource use is more complex to include but comes with two key benefits over the queue:\n- it becomes easier to monitor the length of time a resource is in use by a single entity as users won't 'move through' the resource use stage (which can also prove confusing to less experienced viewers)\n- it becomes possible to show the total number of resources that are available, making it easier to understand how well resources are being utilised at different stages\n\n::: {#fedc65cf .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass CustomResource(simpy.Resource):\n    def __init__(self, env, capacity, id_attribute=None):\n        super().__init__(env, capacity)\n        self.id_attribute = id_attribute\n\n    def request(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Add logic to handle the ID attribute when a request is made\n        # For example, you can assign an ID to the requester\n        # self.id_attribute = assign_id_logic()\n        return super().request(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def release(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Add logic to handle the ID attribute when a release is made\n        # For example, you can reset the ID attribute\n        # reset_id_logic(self.id_attribute)\n        return super().release(*args, **kwargs)\n\ntriage = simpy.Store(self.env)\n\nfor i in range(n_triage):\n    triage.put(\n        CustomResource(\n            env,\n            capacity=1,\n            id_attribute = i+1)\n        )\n\n# request sign-in/triage\ntriage_resource = yield triage.get()\n\nevent_log.append(\n    {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n     'pathway': 'Trauma',\n     'event_type': 'resource_use',\n     'event': 'triage_begins',\n     'time': env.now,\n     'resource_id': triage_resource.id_attribute\n    }\n)\n\nyield self.env.timeout(1)\n\nevent_log.append(\n            {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n             'pathway': 'Trauma',\n             'event_type': 'resource_use_end',\n             'event': 'triage_complete',\n             'time': env.now,\n             'resource_id': triage_resource.id_attribute}\n        )\n\n# Resource is no longer in use, so put it back in the store\ntriage.put(triage_resource)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen providing your event position details, it then just requires you to include an identifier for the resource.\n\nNOTE: At present this requires you to be using an class to manage your resource counts (if following HSMA simpy structure, this will be your g class).\n\nThis requirement is planned to be removed in a future version of the work, allowing more flexibility.\n\n::: {#5035758f .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n{'event': 'TRAUMA_stabilisation_begins',\n 'x': 300, 'y': 500, 'resource':'n_trauma', 'label': \"Being<br>Stabilised\" }\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Creating the animation\n\n### Determining event positioning in the animation\nOnce the event log has been created, the positions of each queue and resource must be set up.\n\nAn easy way to create this is passing a list of dictionaries to the `pd.DataFrame` function.\n\nThe columns required are\n`event`: This must match the label used for the event in the event log\n`x`: The x coordinate of the event for the animation. This will correspond to the bottom-right hand corner of a queue, or the rightmost resource.\n`y`: The y coordinate of the event for the animaation. This will correspond to the lowest row of a queue, or the central point of the resources.\n`label`: A label for the stage. This can be hidden at a later step if you opt to use a background image with labels built-in. Note that line breaks in the label can be created using the HTML tag `<br>`.\n`resource` (OPTIONAL): Only required if the step is a resource_use step. This looks at the 'scenario' object passed to the `animate_activity_log()` function and pulls the attribute with the given name, which should give the number of available resources for that step.\n\n::: {#7b47962f .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n        event_position_df = pd.DataFrame([\n                # Triage\n                {'event': 'triage_wait_begins',\n                 'x':  160, 'y': 400, 'label': \"Waiting for<br>Triage\"  },\n                {'event': 'triage_begins',\n                 'x':  160, 'y': 315, 'resource':'n_triage', 'label': \"Being Triaged\" },\n\n                # Trauma pathway\n                {'event': 'TRAUMA_stabilisation_wait_begins',\n                 'x': 300, 'y': 560, 'label': \"Waiting for<br>Stabilisation\" },\n                {'event': 'TRAUMA_stabilisation_begins',\n                 'x': 300, 'y': 500, 'resource':'n_trauma', 'label': \"Being<br>Stabilised\" },\n\n                {'event': 'TRAUMA_treatment_wait_begins',\n                 'x': 630, 'y': 560, 'label': \"Waiting for<br>Treatment\" },\n                {'event': 'TRAUMA_treatment_begins',\n                 'x': 630, 'y': 500, 'resource':'n_cubicles', 'label': \"Being<br>Treated\" },\n\n                 {'event': 'depart',\n                 'x':  670, 'y': 330, 'label': \"Exit\"}\n            ])\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Creating the animation\nThere are two main ways to create the animation:\n\n- using the one-step function `animate_activity_log()` (see pages/1_Simple_ED_interactive, pages/2_Simple_ED_Forced_Overcrowding or pages/3_Complex_ED_Interactive for examples of this)\n- using the functions `reshape_for_animations()`, `generate_animation_df()` and `generate_animation()` separately, passing the output of each to the next step. This allows you to apply significant extra customisations; examples demonstrating this will be added soon.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThanks are due to\n\n- [Dr Daniel Chalk](https://github.com/hsma-chief-elf) for support and simpy training on the HSMA programme\n- [Professor Tom Monks](https://github.com/TomMonks) for his extensive materials and teaching on the use of simpy in healthcare and his [material on converting code into packages](https://www.pythonhealthdatascience.com/content/03_mgt/03_mgt_front_page.html)\n- [Helena Robinson](https://github.com/helenajr) for testing and bugfinding\n\n# Models used as examples\n\n## Emergency department (Treatment Centre) model\nMonks.T, Harper.A, Anagnoustou.
