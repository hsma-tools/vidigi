Gas Station Refueling example

Covers:

- Resources: Resource
- Resources: Container
- Waiting for other processes

Scenario:
  A gas station has a limited number of gas pumps that share a common
  fuel reservoir. Cars randomly arrive at the gas station, request one
  of the fuel pumps and start refueling from that reservoir.

  A gas station control process observes the gas station's fuel level
  and calls a tank truck for refueling if the station's level drops
  below a threshold.
