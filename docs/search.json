    "section": "Creating a visualisation from an existing model",
    "text": "Creating a visualisation from an existing model\nTwo key things need to happen to existing models to work with the visualisation code: 1. All simpy resources need to be changed to simpy stores containing a custom resource with an ID attribute 2. Logging needs to be added at key points: arrival, (queueing, resource use start, resource use end), departure where the steps in the middle can be repeated for as many queues and resource types as required\n\n1. All simpy resources need to be changed to simpy stores containing a custom resource with an ID attribute\nTo allow the use of resources to be visualised correctly - with entities staying with the same resource throughout the time they are using it - it is essential to be able to identify and track individual resources.\nBy default, this is not possible with Simpy resources. They have no ID attribute or similar.\n\n\nClick here for behind-the-scenes details on this\n\nThe easiest workaround which drops fairly painlessly into existing models is to use a simpy store with a custom resource class.\nThe custom resource is setup as follows:\n\nclass CustomResource(simpy.Resource):\n    def __init__(self, env, capacity, id_attribute=None):\n        super().__init__(env, capacity)\n        self.id_attribute = id_attribute\n\n    def request(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Add logic to handle the ID attribute when a request is made\n        return super().request(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def release(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Add logic to handle the ID attribute when a release is made\n        return super().release(*args, **kwargs)\n\nThe creation of simpy resources is then replaced with the following pattern:\n\nbeds = simpy.Store(environment)\n\nfor i in range(number_of_beds):\n    beds.put(\n        CustomResource(\n            environment,\n            capacity=1,\n            id_attribute=i+1)\n        )\n\n\nvidigi.utils provides a helper function for setting up simpy resources in teh required manner.\nFor a given resource that would have been created like this:\n\nnurses = simpy.Resource(simpy_environment, capacity=number_of_nurses)\n\nYou would use\n\nfrom vidigi.utils import populate_store\nnurses = simpy.Store(simpy_environment)\n\npopulate_store(num_resources=number_of_nurses, simpy_store=nurses, sim_env=simpy_environment)\n\nInstead of requesting a resource in the standard way, you instead use the .get() method.\n\nreq = beds.get()\n\nor\n\nwith beds.get() as req:\n  ...CODE HERE THAT USES THE RESOURCE...\n\nAt the end, it is important to put the resource back into the store, even if you used the ‘with’ notation, so it can be made available to the next requester:\n\nbeds.put(req)\n\nThis becomes slightly more complex with conditional requesting (for example, where a resource request is made but if it cannot be fulfilled in time, the requester will renege). This is demonstrated in example 3.\nThe benefit of this is that when we are logging, we can use the .id_attribute attribute of the custom resource to record the resource that was in use. This can have wider benefits for monitoring individual resource utilisation within your model as well.\n\n\n2. Logging needs to be added at key points\nThe animation function needs to be passed an event log with the following layout:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatient\npathway\nevent_type\nevent\ntime\nresource_id\n\n\n\n\n15\nPrimary\narrival_departure\narrival\n1.22\n\n\n\n15\nPrimary\nqueue\nenter_queue_for_bed\n1.35\n\n\n\n27\nRevision\narrival_departure\narrival\n1.47\n\n\n\n27\nRevision\nqueue\nenter_queue_for_bed\n1.58\n\n\n\n12\nPrimary\nresource_use_end\npost_surgery_stay_ends\n1.9\n4\n\n\n15\nRevision\nresource_use\npost_survery_stay_begins\n1.9\n4\n\n\n\nOne easy way to achieve this is by appending dictionaries to a list at each important point in the process. For example:\n\nevent_log = []\n...\n...\nevent_log.append(\n      {'patient': id,\n      'pathway': 'Revision',\n      'event_type': 'resource_use',\n      'event': 'post_surgery_stay_begins',\n      'time': self.env.now,\n      'resource_id': bed.id_attribute}\n  )\n\nThe list of dictionaries can then be converted to a pandas dataframe using\n\npd.DataFrame(event_log)\n\nand passed to the animation function where required.\n\nEvent types\nFour event types are supported in the model: ‘arrival_departure’, ‘resource_use’, ‘resource_use_end’, and ‘queue’.\nAs a minimum, you will require the use of ‘arrival_departure’ events and one of - ‘resource_use’/‘resource_use_end’ - OR ‘queue’\nYou can also use both ‘resource_use’ and ‘queue’ within the same model very effectively (see ex_1_simplest_case and ex_2_branching_and_optional_paths).\n\narrival_departure\nWithin this, a minimum of two ‘arrival_departure’ events per entity are mandatory - arrival and depart, both with an event_type of arrival_departure, as shown below.\n\nevent_log.append(\n      {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n      'pathway': 'Revision',\n      'event_type': 'arrival_departure',\n      'event': 'arrival',\n      'time': env.now}\n  )\n\n\nevent_log.append(\n      {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n      'pathway': 'Revision',\n      'event_type': 'arrival_departure',\n      'event': 'depart',\n      'time': env.now}\n  )\n\nThese are critical as they are used to determine when patients should first and last appear in the model. Forgetting to include a departure step for all types of patients can lead to slow model performance as the size of the event logs for individual moments will continue to increase indefinitely.\n\n\nqueue\nQueues are key steps in the model.\nIt is possible to solely use queues and never make use of a simpy resource.\nBy tracking each important step in the process as a ‘queue’ step, the movement of patients can be accurately tracked.\nPatients will be ordered by the point at which they are added to the queue, with the first entries appearing at the front (bottom-right) of the queue.\n\nevent_log.append(\n            {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n             'pathway': 'High intensity',\n             'event_type': 'queue',\n             'event': 'appointment_booked_waiting',\n             'time': self.env.now\n             }\n        )\n\nWhile the keys shown above are mandatory, you can add as many additional keys to a step’s log as desired. This can allow you to flexibly make use of the event log for other purposes as well as the animation.\n\n\nresource_use and resource_use_end\nResource use is more complex to include but comes with two key benefits over the queue: - it becomes easier to monitor the length of time a resource is in use by a single entity as users won’t ‘move through’ the resource use stage (which can also prove confusing to less experienced viewers) - it becomes possible to show the total number of resources that are available, making it easier to understand how well resources are being utilised at different stages\n\nclass CustomResource(simpy.Resource):\n    def __init__(self, env, capacity, id_attribute=None):\n        super().__init__(env, capacity)\n        self.id_attribute = id_attribute\n\n    def request(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Add logic to handle the ID attribute when a request is made\n        # For example, you can assign an ID to the requester\n        # self.id_attribute = assign_id_logic()\n        return super().request(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def release(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Add logic to handle the ID attribute when a release is made\n        # For example, you can reset the ID attribute\n        # reset_id_logic(self.id_attribute)\n        return super().release(*args, **kwargs)\n\ntriage = simpy.Store(self.env)\n\nfor i in range(n_triage):\n    triage.put(\n        CustomResource(\n            env,\n            capacity=1,\n            id_attribute = i+1)\n        )\n\n# request sign-in/triage\ntriage_resource = yield triage.get()\n\nevent_log.append(\n    {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n     'pathway': 'Trauma',\n     'event_type': 'resource_use',\n     'event': 'triage_begins',\n     'time': env.now,\n     'resource_id': triage_resource.id_attribute\n    }\n)\n\nyield self.env.timeout(1)\n\nevent_log.append(\n            {'patient': unique_entity_identifier,\n             'pathway': 'Trauma',\n             'event_type': 'resource_use_end',\n             'event': 'triage_complete',\n             'time': env.now,\n             'resource_id': triage_resource.id_attribute}\n        )\n\n# Resource is no longer in use, so put it back in the store\ntriage.put(triage_resource)\n\nWhen providing your event position details, it then just requires you to include an identifier for the resource.\nNOTE: At present this requires you to be using an class to manage your resource counts (if following HSMA simpy structure, this will be your g class).\nThis requirement is planned to be removed in a future version of the work, allowing more flexibility.\n\n{'event': 'TRAUMA_stabilisation_begins',\n 'x': 300, 'y': 500, 'resource':'n_trauma', 'label': \"Being&lt;br&gt;Stabilised\" }",

Note that line breaks in the label can be created using the HTML tag &lt;br&gt;. resource (OPTIONAL): Only required if the step is a resource_use step.

It is written like this at present because of the ease of transforming this structure of dictionary to a dataframe and the flexibility of the structure, but exploring alternatives like key:value pairs of event:time could be explored.\nCurrenly, the key logs take the following format\nArrival:\nself.full_event_log.append({\n    'patient': self.identifier,\n    'pathway': 'Simplest',\n    'event_type': 'arrival_departure',\n    'event': 'arrival',\n    'time': self.env.now\n})\nQueueing:\nself.full_event_log.append({\n    'patient': self.identifier,\n    'pathway': 'Simplest',\n    'event': 'treatment_wait_begins',\n    'event_type': 'queue',\n    'time': self.env.now\n})\nResource Use Start:\nself.full_event_log.append({\n    'patient': self.identifier,\n    'pathway': 'Simplest',\n    'event': 'treatment_begins',\n    'event_type': 'resource_use',\n    'time': self.env.now,\n    'resource_id': treatment_resource.id_attribute\n})\nResource Use End:\nself.full_event_log.append({\n    'patient': self.identifier,\n    'pathway': 'Simplest',\n    'event': 'treatment_complete',\n    'event_type': 'resource_use_end',\n    'time': self.env.now,\n    'resource_id': treatment_resource.id_attribute\n})\nDeparture:\nself.full_event_log.append({\n    'patient': self.identifier,\n    'pathway': 'Simplest',\n    'event': 'depart',\n    'event_type': 'arrival_departure',\n    'time': self.env.now\n})"

    "text": "2. Swapping the use of resources for simpy stores containing resources\nWhen a resource is in use, we need to be able to show a single entity consistently hogging the same resource throughout the full time they are using it.\nSimpy resources do not inherently have any ID attribute. After exploring options like monkey patching the resource class, a better alternative seemed to be using a simpy store - which does have an ID - instead of a straight resource.\nWithout this ID attribute, the default logic used to move entities through the steps results in them visually behaving like a queue, which makes it hard to understand how long someone has been using a resource for and is visually confusing.\nFortunately the code changes required are minimal. We initialise the store, then use a loop to create as many resources within that store as required.\ndef init_resources(self):\n    '''\n    Init the number of resources\n    and store in the arguments container object\n\n    Resource list:\n        1. Nurses/treatment bays (same thing in this model)\n\n    '''\n    self.args.treatment = simpy.Store(self.env)\n\n    for i in range(self.args.n_cubicles_1):\n        self.args.treatment.put(\n            CustomResource(\n                self.env,\n                capacity=1,\n                id_attribute = i+1)\n            )\nUse of the resource then becomes\n# Seize a treatment resource when available\ntreatment_resource = yield self.args.treatment.get()\nWhen the timeout has elapsed, we then use the following code.\n# Resource is no longer in use, so put it back in\nself.args.treatment.put(treatment_resource)\nThis has additional benefits of making it easier to monitor the use of individual resources.\nOne thing that has been noticed is that the resources seem to be cycled through in order. For example, if you have 4 resources and all are available, but the last resource to be in use was resource 2, resource 3 will be seized the next time someone requires a resource. This may not be entirely realistic, and code to ‘shake up’ the resources after use may be worth exploring."
