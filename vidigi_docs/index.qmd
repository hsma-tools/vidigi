Welcome to vidigi - a package for visualising real or simulated pathways.

{{< video videos/vidigi.mp4 >}}

Primarily developed for healthcare simulation and intended to allow easy integration with tools like Streamlit so users can see the impact of changes to simulation parameters in real-time, vidigi handles the conversion of your simulation event logs into engaging and flexible animations.

With just a minimal set of logs - with helper functions provided to make that easier than ever to integrate into existing SimPy or Ciw simulations - you can start generating and customising your visualisations in minutes.

## Getting Started

- Install vidigi from PyPi with the command `pip install vidigi`
- Read the [introduction](introduction.qmd) to get an overview of the core vidigi concepts
- Read a step-by-step walkthrough of [adding vidigi to an existing SimPy model](adding_vidigi_to_a_simple_simpy_model_hsma_structure.qmd)
